# Task-Manager

This is my first personal GUI application that I have developed using Win32SDK in C language. In this application, I have tried to replicate the features of the original Task Manager present in Windows operating system as close as possible. Currently the application shows PID, Process name, Path of executable, and RAM usage of every process. I am going to keep updating this application by adding more and more features and make it as original as the Microsoft's Task Manager.
